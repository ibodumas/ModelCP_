		Stocks of hospital companies rose sharply and some insurance companies fell Thursday 
		after the Supreme Court upheld a requirement that almost all Americans carry health 
		insurance. The stock of Hospital Corp. of American, the largest private hospital 
		chain in the United States, climbed 10 percent. Community Health Systems rose 8 
		percent, Health Management Associates 7 percent. Quest Diagnostics, which runs 
		laboratories, and Laborary Corp. of America both gained more than 2 percent.
		The ruling was a win for hospital operators because it will add 32 million 
		Americans to the rolls of the insured, vastly expanding the pool of health 
		care consumers, said Jeffrey Loo, a stock analyst with S&amp;P Capital IQ, a 
		research group. Under the current system, about one-fourth of the care provided 
		by hospitals is never paid for, either because debts go bad or because the patient is 
		uninsured, Loo said. He said the law will cut the portion of care that is not paid for 
		in half, However, Gary Taylor, a financial analyst for Citi Investment Research, warned 
		clients that hospital stocks could erase all their gains from the court decision if 
		Mitt Romney is elected president this fall. He has pledged to repel the law. Many 
		insurance companies fell sharply after the ruling was announced. They bounced around 
		while reporters and analysts dissected the court's ruling, and they later recovered 
		some of the losses.
